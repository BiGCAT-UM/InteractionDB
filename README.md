Interaction Bridge Database
==========================

This is a java application to create a BridgeDb derby database to map identifiers of interactions from 
different databases to each other. It has been created using the interaction mapping from Rhea 
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/rhea/). The identifier from Rhea is mapped to identifiers from Enzyme Code, 
EcoCyc, MetaCyc, Macie, Reactome, Kegg Reaction, Unipathway, and Uniprot. This database can be used to 
annotate interactions in PathVisio(http://www.pathvisio.org/), which are displayed in Wikipathways
(http://wikipathways.org/index.php/WikiPathways) as linkouts to the corresponding databases fetched through the [webservice from BridgeDB](https://bridgedb.github.io/pages/webservice.html).
